Rebuild: `python3 build.py vs wh er cc as1 as2 write` (one file: `python3 build.py vs:q_vs_v2 write`; omit `write` to audit answer lengths).
Per-item length ranks: `python3 lens.py q_vs_v1`. Contact sheet of images: `python3 vsheet.py out.jpg Key1 Key2 …`.

`build.py`, `lens.py`, `vsheet.py` and the loader in `images.py` are copied from `Week 14/notes/Quiz/_source/`.
Images come from `../../assets/vasc-surg/` (lecture slides) and AMBOSS. **No UWorld images.**
Masked giveaways: "LA Thrombus" label (left atrial CT), "Arteries"/"Clot" labels (SMA CT), "Common Femoral Artery Occlusion"
label (angiogram), stray panel letters on the popliteal angiogram and post-thrombotic photo. Captions name the view, never the diagnosis.
V1 and V2 cover different angles; the app reshuffles choices at runtime.

Women and Exercise Rehab quizzes (Qazi, no recordings) are concept/number-based, so images are used only where a graph is the point
(menarche U-curve, preterm-delivery hazard curve, prevalence chart, stroke-volume curve with its axis label removed, BP response,
Blair fitness bars, PREDIMED, DASH-Sodium). Panel letters masked. A few items are tagged Board add-on in their explanations
(SCAD, Takotsubo, atypical MI symptoms, exercise hypotension, Karvonen formula).

## Rewrite (2026-10-02)
All six Week 15 quizzes were rewritten to Jeeval's NBME/NBOME item-writer spec: house-style stems (exact durations, vitals format,
explicit negatives that kill options, inventory lead-ins), one buried clue + one decoy per item, homogeneous option families with
4–7 options (ordered series, matched-set table rows, extended differentials, communication scripts, one chart-format item per
vascular quiz), and counterfactual wrong-answer explanations ("Would be correct if…"). Images kept (his instruction).
`build.py` now turns "\n" in a stem into <br> so chart and table stems render.

## Cardiac Cycle & Valve Hemodynamics (2026-10-06)
V1 and V2, 18 items each, to the NBME/NBOME spec. Sources: Qazi deck + the two-part recording; Board add-ons from the UWorld and AMBOSS libraries are noted in the explanations.
Images (keys `Cms Cas Cmr Car Casx Cph` in `images.py`) come from `../../assets/cardiac-cycle/`. **Masked giveaways:** lesion titles on all four
tracings ("Mitral Valve Stenosis", etc.), the "Tall v-wave" label (MR), the "↑Systolic AP", "↑LAP" and "↓Diastolic AP" labels (AR), the
"Normal / Aortic Stenosis" labels under the schematic (cropped), and the phase-slide titles such as "All Valves Closed" (cropped to the graph). Captions name the
curve colours, never the lesion. V1 covers phases, valve opening pressure, S3/S4, EF arithmetic, tachycardia in cardiomyopathy, AF and the atrial kick, the MS gradient,
AS exam/bicuspid screening/TAVR/LA pressure, the post-inferior-MI papillary muscle, MVP histology, AR diastolic pressure, MR remodeling, a chart-format rheumatic MS item, and the v wave.
V2 covers different angles: reading each tracing (MS auscultation, MR diagnosis, AR pulse), concentric hypertrophy, the end of isovolumetric relaxation, AF and interval 1,
the A2–opening snap interval, warfarin in MS with AF, exertional syncope, chart-format AS, valve area by murmur timing, nitrates in AS, when MR backflow begins,
MVP on standing, acute chordal rupture, secondary MR, coronary perfusion pressure in AR, and the AR murmur grid.
Length audit after balancing: V1 key longest 1/10, shortest 1/10; V2 1/8 and 1/8 (chance ≈ 2 and 1.6).

## Application Session 1 — Chest Pain & Secondary HTN (2026-10-07)
V1 and V2, 18 items each (≈9 CAD case / 9 HTN case per version), NBME spec. Images (`images.py` keys): `A1xanth` and `A1arcus` (individual photos cropped out of the
labelled FH-signs slide, upscaled), `A1ecg` (case NSTEMI ECG, journal caption cropped off), `A1vsr` (case echo; header with "VSR …" patient label blacked out),
and clean AMBOSS figures `Aretino` (grade IV hypertensive retinopathy), `Ahypok` (hypokalemia ECG), `Alvh` (LVH with strain), `Ainfstemi` (acute inferior STEMI).
V1: ischemic history feature, FH genetics (tendon xanthoma), exercise stress echo for uninterpretable ECG, office NSTE-ACS (no car), NSTEMI <24 h timing, type 2 MI,

hypokalemic nephrogenic DI, aldosterone escape, MRA washout, chart-format AVS before adrenalectomy, eplerenone for gynecomastia.
V2: smoking RR in women, FH by arcus, LVH ECG → concentric LVH, CAC in CAD Consortium, nitrates in HOCM, verapamil in HFrEF, ivabradine phosphenes, NSTEMI ED care
(no lytics), VSR echo, inferior STEMI ECG → posteromedial papillary rupture, severe HTN → assess TOD first, chart-format atherosclerotic RAS, RAS renin/aldo grid,
licorice/AME, Gordon syndrome, β-blocker false-positive ARR, bilateral hyperplasia, PA complication ORs (AF).
Length audit after balancing: V1 key longest 1/10, shortest 2/10; V2 1/8 and 2/8.

## Application Session 2 — Heart Failure & PAD (2026-10-07)
V1 and V2, 18 items each (≈7 HFpEF, ≈5 ADHF/GDMT, ≈6 PAD), NBME spec. Images: lecture `A2ecg` (case LVH ECG), `A2psax` (concentric LVH echo), `A2cxr` (case
Kerley-line CXR), `A2rubor` (panel letter masked), `A2leriche` (journal caption cropped off; arrows kept), and clean AMBOSS `Aedema` (pitting edema), `Acpe`
(cardiogenic pulmonary edema CXR), `Adcm` (dilated cardiomyopathy gross), `Agangrene` (toe gangrene).
V1: nephrotic edema (↓ oncotic), NT-proBNP on an ARNI, S4 in HFpEF (case ECG), H₂FPEF arithmetic, diuretic braking, diuretic hypokalemic alkalosis, SGLT2i TGF,

Length audit after balancing: V1 key longest 1/9, shortest 1/9; V2 1/6 and 1/6.
