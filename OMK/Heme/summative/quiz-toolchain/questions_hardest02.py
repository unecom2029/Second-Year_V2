# ── 21. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis (§15) ────────────────────────────────────
q(
    "A 44-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to a painful, darkening lesion on "
    "her left thigh. Four days ago she was diagnosed with a proximal deep vein thrombosis and "
    "started on warfarin; no parenteral anticoagulant was given. Her brother had an unprovoked "
    "pulmonary embolism at age 30. Her platelet count is 268,000/mm3 and the international "
    "normalized ratio is 3.1. The lesion is shown. Biopsy of the affected skin shows fibrin "
    "thrombi occluding dermal and subcutaneous venules with hemorrhagic necrosis of the overlying "
    "tissue and no vasculitis. Which of the following best explains this patient's lesion?",
    {
        "Antibodies against a heparin-platelet factor 4 complex":
            "This is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which also causes thrombosis with skin "
            "necrosis — but it requires heparin exposure, and the platelet count falls by more than "
            "half. She received no heparin and her platelets are normal.",
        "Calcium phosphate deposition in small vessels":
            "This is calciphylaxis, which produces very similar painful necrotic skin lesions — but "
            "in patients with end-stage kidney disease and disordered calcium and phosphate, not "
            "4 days after starting a drug.",
        "Faster decline of protein C than prothrombin": "",
        "Immune complex deposition in venule walls":
            "This is leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which shows fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls with "
            "a neutrophilic infiltrate and nuclear dust. The biopsy explicitly shows bland thrombi "
            "without vasculitis.",
        "Mutant factor V resisting inactivation by protein C":
            "Factor V Leiden explains why she and her brother clot in the first place, and it "
            "amplifies this complication — but on its own it does not produce skin necrosis in the "
            "first days of a new drug.",
    },
    "Faster decline of protein C than prothrombin",
    "Warfarin-induced skin necrosis, from starting warfarin without bridging.\n\n"
    "Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase → the liver cannot carboxylate factors II, VII, "
    "IX and X, or the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S. Those proteins do not "
    "disappear at the same rate — each falls at the pace of its own half-life:\n"
    "• Factor VII ~4–6 hours (shortest) — this is what moves the INR first\n"
    "• Protein C ~8 hours — the natural ANTICOAGULANT\n"
    "• Factor IX ~24 hours\n"
    "• Factor X ~48–72 hours\n"
    "• Factor II (prothrombin) ~60 hours (longest)\n\n"
    "So in the first days the body loses protein C before it loses prothrombin → a transient "
    "HYPERcoagulable window → thrombosis of dermal and subcutaneous venules, classically over fatty "
    "areas (thigh, breast, buttock) → hemorrhagic skin necrosis. The risk is greatest in those with "
    "underlying protein C deficiency or another thrombophilia, and after a large loading dose.\n\n"
    "The same arithmetic explains the other trap: an INR of 2.3 on day 2 reflects loss of factor "
    "VII, not true anticoagulation, because prothrombin is still present. Both problems have one "
    "fix — bridge with heparin or enoxaparin for at least 5 days AND until the INR has been "
    "therapeutic for 24 hours.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Warfarin depletes protein C faster than prothrombin, creating a "
    "transient hypercoagulable state in the first days of therapy that can cause skin necrosis over "
    "fatty areas. Bridging with a heparin until the INR has been therapeutic for 24 hours, for at "
    "least 5 days, prevents both this and inadequate early anticoagulation.",
    "Warfarin switches off both the body's clot-makers and its clot-brakes, and the brakes wear off "
    "first. For a few days she was actually more likely to clot, so tiny vessels in her skin "
    "blocked and the skin died.",

    "and new bruises over both forearms. He has atrial fibrillation and has taken warfarin for 3 "
    "years, with an international normalized ratio consistently between 2.2 and 2.6 at monthly "

            "This is the pharmacodynamic half of the antibiotic interaction and does raise the INR — "
            "but fluconazole is an antifungal and does not eliminate the vitamin K-producing "
            "bacterial flora.",
        "Reduced dietary intake of vitamin K":
            "A sudden fall in leafy green intake raises the INR, and a sudden rise lowers it. His "
            "diet is explicitly unchanged.",
        "Variant VKORC1 conferring target sensitivity":
            "Polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 explain why dose requirements differ so much between "

    "• ↓ INR by enzyme INDUCTION — rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St John's wort\n"
    "• ↑ bleeding at an UNCHANGED INR — aspirin, other antiplatelets, nonsteroidal "
    "anti-inflammatory drugs (pharmacodynamic)\n"
    "• ↑ INR from LESS SUBSTRATE — any antibiotic that kills vitamin K-producing gut flora\n"
    "• Food and drink — a sudden increase in leafy greens lowers the INR (consistency matters more "
    "than avoidance); an acute alcohol binge raises it, while chronic use induces and lowers it\n\n"
    "Management here: hold warfarin, give vitamin K, and for serious or life-threatening bleeding "

    "and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes ago. He takes low-dose aspirin and a statin. "
    "Blood pressure is 168/92 mm Hg. Noncontrast head computed tomography shows no hemorrhage, and "
    "intravenous alteplase is started. Two hours later he develops a severe headache, vomiting, and "
    "a declining level of consciousness, and he dies the following day. A coronal section of the "
    "brain at autopsy is shown. Which of the following drug actions is most directly responsible "
    "for this complication?",
    {
        "Blockade of platelet adenosine diphosphate receptors":
            "This is clopidogrel and the other P2Y12 blockers. They raise bleeding risk modestly but "

        "Conversion of plasminogen to plasmin": "",
        "Inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1":
            "This is his aspirin, which irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase-1 and blocks "
            "thromboxane A2 for the platelet's 7–10 day life. It contributes to bleeding risk but "
            "cannot lyse an intracranial clot within 2 hours.",
        "Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase":
            "This is warfarin's mechanism, producing bleeding through a multiple factor deficiency "
            "over days. He is not on warfarin, and the event was immediate.",
        "Potentiation of antithrombin activity":
            "This is how the heparins work. Heparin-associated bleeding is possible, but he received "

    "Conversion of plasminogen to plasmin",
    "Intracranial hemorrhage after thrombolysis — the feared complication of the -plase drugs, and "
    "the reason their contraindication list exists.\n\n"
    "Mechanism: alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) converts plasminogen → plasmin "
    "→ plasmin digests the fibrin mesh holding a clot together (fibrin degradation products are "
    "measured as the D-dimer). These agents are only RELATIVELY fibrin-selective, so hemostatic "
    "plugs elsewhere are lysed too — systemic bleeding is the defining risk, and bleeding into the "
    "brain is the one you cannot take back.\n\n"
    "If catastrophic bleeding occurs: stop the infusion, image the head, give CRYOPRECIPITATE to "
    "replace the fibrinogen plasmin has consumed, and give an ANTIFIBRINOLYTIC — tranexamic acid or "
    "aminocaproic acid — which blocks plasminogen from becoming plasmin, the exact mirror image of "
    "the drug.\n\n"
    "The contraindications all follow from 'you are about to dissolve every clot in the body': prior "
    "intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke within 3 months, intracranial neoplasm or vascular "
    "malformation, suspected aortic dissection, active internal bleeding or bleeding diathesis, "
    "significant closed head trauma within 3 months, and severe uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Thrombolytics (alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase) convert plasminogen "
    "to plasmin, which degrades fibrin; intracranial hemorrhage is the feared complication. "
    "Treatment is to stop the drug, replace fibrinogen with cryoprecipitate, and give tranexamic or "
    "aminocaproic acid to block further plasmin generation.",
    "The clot-busting drug switches on the body's demolition crew to chew up a clot in a brain "

    "state, and the anticoagulant choice is decided by what crosses the placenta.\n\n"
    "Heparins — unfractionated and low-molecular-weight — are large, highly charged molecules that "
    "do NOT cross the placenta, so they are the anticoagulants of pregnancy. Low-molecular-weight "

    "routine outpatient venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation → a direct oral "
    "anticoagulant, usually apixaban.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Heparins do not cross the placenta and are the anticoagulants of choice "
    "in pregnancy, with low-molecular-weight heparin preferred for outpatient therapy. Warfarin is "
    "teratogenic and direct oral anticoagulants lack established pregnancy safety data.",
    "Her blood thinner has to be one that cannot cross into the baby. Heparin shots are too big to "

q(
    "A 66-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of anemia of chronic kidney disease. He "
    "has received hemodialysis for 3 years and epoetin alfa for the past 6 weeks. He reports a "
    "dull headache for several days. His hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dL two weeks ago and is 10.9 g/dL "
    "today. Ferritin is 420 ng/mL (N=20–250 ng/mL) and transferrin saturation is 32% (N=20%–50%). "
    "Blood pressure is 176/102 mm Hg, compared with 138/84 mm Hg before treatment was started. "
    "Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    {
        "Add intravenous iron sucrose":
            "Functional iron deficiency is the commonest reason an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent "
            "appears not to work — but his ferritin and transferrin saturation show replete stores, "
            "and his hemoglobin is rising too fast, not too slowly.",
        "Continue the current dose unchanged":
            "This ignores both boxed-warning rules at once: the rate of rise and the developing "
            "hypertension, which is the most common adverse effect of the class and has progressed "
            "to symptoms.",
        "Decrease the epoetin alfa dose": "",
        "Increase the dose to target 12 g/dL":
            "Targeting hemoglobin above 11 g/dL increases death, serious cardiovascular events and "
            "stroke in chronic kidney disease, with no additional benefit. The goal is the lowest "
            "dose that avoids transfusion.",
        "Switch to oral vadadustat":
            "The hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor is an oral alternative for "
            "dialysis patients, but it carries its own boxed warning for thrombotic events and is "
            "contraindicated in uncontrolled hypertension — exactly what he now has.",
        "Transfuse one unit of red blood cells":
            "Transfusion is for symptomatic anemia, usually below a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL. His "
            "hemoglobin is 10.9 and climbing.",
    },
    "Decrease the epoetin alfa dose",
    "Two numbers govern erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dosing, and this patient has broken both.\n\n"
    "• The CEILING — every boxed warning turns on the same threshold: targeting a hemoglobin above "
    "11 g/dL causes harm with no benefit (increased death, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous "
    "thromboembolism and vascular access thrombosis).\n"
    "• The RATE — if the hemoglobin rises more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period, decrease the dose. "
    "His rose 1.7 g/dL.\n\n"
    "Why the rate matters: hypertension is the most common adverse effect, occurring in up to a "
    "third of treated patients, and a rapid rise in red cell mass drives it. Hypertensive "
    "encephalopathy has been reported, and seizures are a recognised risk in chronic kidney "
    "disease. Control blood pressure before starting, and note that subcutaneous dosing raises blood "
    "pressure less and reaches target at 15%–30% lower doses than intravenous.\n\n"
    "Mechanism for context: these agents stimulate division and differentiation of committed "
    "erythroid progenitors and push reticulocytes into the blood — reticulocytes rise first, then "
    "hematocrit and hemoglobin. They are approved for anemia of chronic kidney disease and "
    "chemotherapy-induced anemia, only when the goal is avoiding transfusion, and only after iron "
    "stores are checked and repleted.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents should be dosed to the lowest level "
    "that avoids transfusion; targeting a hemoglobin above 11 g/dL increases cardiovascular events "
    "and death, and a rise of more than 1 g/dL in 2 weeks requires a dose reduction. Hypertension "
    "is the most common adverse effect.",
    "The medicine tells his marrow to build red cells, and it worked too fast. Thicker blood pushed "
    "his blood pressure up, so the dose comes down rather than up.",
