            "the hemoglobin rise rather than produce a progressive myelopathy.",
        "Folate has caused a drug-induced peripheral neuropathy":
            "Folic acid is essentially nontoxic even at high doses and is rapidly excreted in the "
            "urine. The neurologic disease is the untreated deficiency, not the treatment.",
        "The neurologic findings are unrelated to the hematologic disorder":
            "Dorsal column signs with a macrocytic anemia in a strict vegan are one disease, not two. "

    "B12 has TWO jobs; folate has only the first:\n"
    "• DNA synthesis — shared with folate, so folate alone repairs the megaloblastic anemia\n"
    "• Maintenance of myelin — B12 ONLY, so the dorsal and lateral column degeneration continues "
    "unopposed and eventually becomes irreversible\n\n"

    "better, and the subacute combined degeneration progresses. Always check a B12 level BEFORE "

    "How the two are separated when both cause macrocytosis with hypersegmented neutrophils: "
    "METHYLMALONIC ACID is elevated in B12 deficiency and normal in folate deficiency, while "
    "homocysteine rises in both and therefore discriminates nothing. If you can order one test, order "
    "the methylmalonic acid. And the clinical version: B12 has the Brain; folate does not.\n\n"
    "His raised lactate dehydrogenase with a low reticulocyte count is the signature of ineffective "
    "erythropoiesis — precursors made in large numbers and destroyed inside the marrow. A strict "
    "vegan diet is a genuine risk factor because plants contain very little cobalamin; other routes "

    "Educational objective: Folate corrects the megaloblastic anemia of vitamin B12 deficiency while "
    "the neurologic degeneration continues, so a B12 level must be checked before treating any "

    "• RESULT — no difference in 30-day mortality, and the LIBERAL arm, which received more blood, "

    "Why the euvolemic entry criterion matters: an actively bleeding patient loses whole blood — "

    "What they are explicitly NOT for: promoting wound healing or shortening time to ambulation. Both "

            "The 10,000 threshold is for a NON-BLEEDING patient with hypoproliferative "

    "The commonest plasma error in the hospital is someone seeing an INR of 1.1 or 1.4 and ordering "
    "plasma to normalize it. The transfusion achieves nothing measurable while exposing the patient "
    "to a transfusion reaction, a residual infectious risk and a volume load. You are not treating "
    "the patient; you are treating the number.\n\n"
    "Liver disease sharpens the point further: the liver makes both the procoagulant factors AND "
    "protein C, protein S and antithrombin, so losing both sides leaves a rebalanced but fragile "
    "hemostasis. The INR measures only the procoagulant half, so it reports a coagulopathy the "
    "patient may not clinically have — quite unlike warfarin, where the INR is a validated, "
    "dose-calibrated measure.\n\n"
    "The legitimate indications for plasma: a documented factor deficiency AND active bleeding; a "
    "markedly prolonged clotting time before a procedure; and warfarin reversal, where prothrombin "
    "complex concentrate plus vitamin K is preferred. Not for a single factor deficiency — give the "
    "specific concentrate.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Approximately 30% coagulation factor activity is sufficient for "
    "hemostasis, so plasma given for a mildly raised INR provides no benefit while exposing the "
    "patient to transfusion risk; in liver disease the INR particularly overstates bleeding risk "
    "because the natural anticoagulants fall in parallel.",

    "To inactivate THROMBIN, antithrombin and thrombin must be BRIDGED together, and only a long "
    "heparin tail can span that bridge. To inactivate FACTOR Xa, no bridge is needed: once heparin "

    "symptoms. His CD4 count is 140/mm3 and HIV RNA is 320,000 copies/mL. Toxoplasma IgG is negative, "
    "a tuberculin skin test is negative, and cryptococcal antigen is negative. Antiretroviral therapy "
    "is started today. Which of the following prophylactic regimens is most appropriate now?",
    {
        "Azithromycin weekly":
            "Prophylaxis against disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex is considered at CD4 counts "
            "below 50/mm3, and is largely unnecessary when antiretroviral therapy is started "
            "promptly. His count is 140.",
        "Fluconazole daily":
            "Antifungal prophylaxis is not routine. His cryptococcal antigen is negative, and "
            "candidiasis is treated when it occurs rather than prevented.",
        "No prophylaxis is indicated at this CD4 count":
            "The threshold for Pneumocystis prophylaxis is 200/mm3, and he is well below it. This is "
            "the trap of confusing the two CD4 numbers.",
        "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole daily": "",
        "Valganciclovir daily":
            "Cytomegalovirus disease — retinitis, esophagitis, colitis — occurs below 50/mm3, and "
            "prophylaxis is not standard; surveillance and treatment of established disease are.",
    },
    "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole daily",
    "Two CD4 numbers do different jobs, and confusing them is the commonest error here:\n"
    "• CD4 BELOW 200/mm3 (or under 14%) DEFINES AIDS — CDC stage 3 — and is the threshold for "
    "Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. An AIDS-defining opportunistic infection also defines stage "
    "3 at any CD4 count\n"
    "• CD4 BELOW 50/mm3 is where opportunistic infection risk is GREATEST — cytomegalovirus, "
    "Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptococcus, primary central nervous system lymphoma\n\n"
    "At 140/mm3 he needs trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, continued until the immune system "
    "reconstitutes on therapy. The prophylaxis table by threshold:\n"
    "• Below 200 — trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis; check a cryptococcal antigen\n"
    "• Below 100 — prophylaxis in Toxoplasma IgG-POSITIVE patients, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole "
    "covers both (his toxoplasma serology is negative, so that indication does not arise)\n"
    "• Any CD4 count — treat latent tuberculosis if the skin test or interferon-gamma release assay "
    "is positive\n\n"
    "Also worth holding: the CD4 count is the STAGING variable — it measures immune damage and drives "
    "prophylaxis — while the viral load is the TRANSMISSION and treatment-response variable, and the "
    "basis of undetectable equals untransmittable. A useful shortcut when the CD4 has not returned: "
    "an absolute lymphocyte count below 1,000/mm3 predicts a CD4 below 200.\n\n"
    "And the live vaccine rule that follows from the same threshold: varicella, yellow fever and "
    "measles-mumps-rubella may be given only when CD4 is 200/mm3 or above; the recombinant zoster "
    "vaccine is the one to use in immunocompromised patients.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: A CD4 count below 200/mm3 defines AIDS and is the threshold for "
    "Pneumocystis prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, whereas below 50/mm3 is where "
    "cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium complex and cryptococcal disease risk is greatest — two "
    "different numbers with two different purposes.",

# ── 120. One mutation kills a whole antiretroviral class (card 24) ─────────────
q(
    "A 42-year-old woman with HIV infection has taken a regimen of tenofovir, emtricitabine and "
    "efavirenz for 3 years, with an undetectable viral load until 6 months ago. She reports missing "
    "doses frequently during a period of housing instability. Her HIV RNA is now 68,000 copies/mL and "
    "her CD4 count has fallen from 620 to 410/mm3. Genotypic resistance testing identifies a single "
    "amino acid substitution at position 103 of reverse transcriptase, in a conserved region of the "
    "enzyme's allosteric pocket. Which of the following best describes the consequence of this single "
    "mutation?",
    {
        "It abolishes activity of all non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors": "",
        "It abolishes activity of all integrase strand transfer inhibitors":
            "Integrase resistance arises from mutations altering integrase structure, not reverse "
            "transcriptase, and would not follow from a change in this enzyme.",
        "It confers resistance only to the specific drug she is taking":
            "That would be true if the drugs bound different sites — but the entire non-nucleoside "
            "class shares one allosteric pocket, which is precisely why the barrier is so low.",
        "It confers high-level resistance to all protease inhibitors":
            "Protease inhibitors have a HIGH genetic barrier; resistance is uncommon unless the "
            "patient has previously been treated with one, and it requires accumulated mutations.",
        "It prevents nucleoside analogues from being incorporated into viral DNA chains":
            "Nucleoside analogue resistance occurs through point mutations that reduce binding "
            "affinity, and generally requires accumulated mutations rather than a single change.",
    },
    "It abolishes activity of all non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors",
    "The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have the LOWEST genetic barrier to "
    "resistance of any antiretroviral class, and the reason is structural: every member — efavirenz, "
    "doravirine and the rest — binds the SAME allosteric pocket on reverse transcriptase, "
    "non-competitively, causing a conformational change that disables the enzyme. A single point "
    "mutation in that conserved pocket therefore knocks out the whole class at once.\n\n"
    "Compare the rest of the spectrum:\n"
    "• NRTIs — nucleoside analogues that bind competitively at the active site and cause chain "
    "termination. Resistance mutations reduce binding AFFINITY rather than abolishing it, so it "
    "generally takes accumulated mutations\n"
    "• PROTEASE INHIBITORS — a HIGH barrier; resistance is uncommon unless the patient has previously "
    "been treated with one\n"
    "• LENACAPAVIR (capsid inhibitor) — the extreme case in the other direction: a single capsid "
    "mutation confers more than 80,000-fold resistance\n"
    "• INSTIs — resistance arises from mutations altering integrase structure and reducing drug "
    "binding\n\n"
    "The upstream cause is always the same: reverse transcriptase has a high error rate, which "
    "generates the variant pool that selection acts on — and poor adherence supplies the selection "
    "pressure by keeping drug levels in the range where resistant virus outgrows wild type. That is "
    "why adherence support, not simply a new prescription, is half the management here.\n\n"
    "Practical consequence: she needs a new regimen guided by the genotype, and the non-nucleoside "
    "class is closed to her — not just the single drug she was taking.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: All non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors bind the same "
    "allosteric pocket, so one point mutation in that conserved region confers resistance to the "
    "entire class; nucleoside analogues generally require accumulated mutations and protease "
    "inhibitors have a high genetic barrier.",
    "Every drug in that family grabs the same handle on the virus's copying enzyme. Change the shape "
