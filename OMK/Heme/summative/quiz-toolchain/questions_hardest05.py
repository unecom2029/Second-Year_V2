# ── 81. Why combination chemotherapy (§43) ─────────────────────────────────────
q(
    "A 61-year-old man with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is to begin treatment. The "
    "planned regimen contains rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. "
    "His son asks why five drugs are needed rather than a higher dose of the single most effective "
    "one. Which of the following best explains the use of several agents together?",
    {
        "Agents with different mechanisms allow full dosing of each": "",
        "Combining agents allows each to be given at a lower, safer dose":
            "The aim is the opposite — non-overlapping toxicity is what permits each drug to be given "
            "at its OWN full dose. Dose reduction is what you are forced into when two agents share a "
            "toxicity.",
        "Each agent targets a different phase of the cell cycle":
            "Phase coverage is a real consideration, but two of these agents are cell cycle-NONspecific "
            "and one is an antibody. It is not what the combination principle rests on.",
        "Multiple agents shorten the total duration of therapy":
            "Cytotoxic therapy kills a constant FRACTION of cells per dose, so repeated cycles are "
            "mathematically necessary regardless of how many drugs are combined.",
        "Using several agents avoids the need for growth factor support":
            "Combining myelosuppressive agents makes growth factor support more likely to be needed, "
            "not less.",
    },
    "Agents with different mechanisms allow full dosing of each",
    "The principles that make a combination regimen better than a single agent:\n\n"
    "• A LARGER SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY — a heterogeneous tumour contains subclones with different "
    "vulnerabilities, and more mechanisms hit more of them\n"
    "• DIFFERING MECHANISMS and DIFFERING TOXICITIES — different mechanisms give additive kill, and "
    "non-overlapping toxicity means each drug can be given at full dose. If two agents share an "
    "adverse effect you must dose-reduce, which is exactly what you are trying to avoid\n"
    "• A LOWER RATE OF RESISTANCE — the cell must acquire several independent resistance mechanisms "
    "at once rather than one\n\n"
    "R-CHOP is the worked example, and every letter is a different mechanism with a different "
    "toxicity: Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody), Cyclophosphamide (alkylator — haemorrhagic cystitis), "
    "Hydroxydaunorubicin/doxorubicin (anthracycline — cardiomyopathy), Oncovin/vincristine (vinca — "
    "neurotoxicity), Prednisone (corticosteroid).\n\n"
    "Why repeated cycles are unavoidable: cytotoxic agents follow first-order kinetics, killing a "
    "constant FRACTION of cells per dose — the log-kill hypothesis. Taking a burden from 10⁸ to 10⁵ "
    "is a 3-log kill, and no single dose can ever sterilize a tumour because a fixed fraction always "
    "survives. Note also the 10⁹ cell (about 1 gram) threshold of clinical detectability: everything "
    "below it is the subclinical disease that adjuvant chemotherapy exists to treat.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Combination chemotherapy uses agents with different mechanisms of action "
    "and non-overlapping toxicities so that each can be given at full dose, which broadens the "
    "spectrum of activity against a heterogeneous tumour and reduces the emergence of resistance.",
    "Five different drugs attack the cancer in five different ways and damage five different parts of "
    "the body. Because they do not pile up on the same organ, each can be given at its full strength.",

q(
    "A 58-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer has a partial response to doxorubicin, then "
    "progresses after 7 months. She is switched to a regimen containing vinblastine and etoposide, "
    "and her disease progresses again within 8 weeks despite never having received either drug. The "
    "three agents are structurally unrelated and act by different mechanisms. Which of the following "
    "best explains the pattern of resistance in this patient?",
    {
        "Amplification of the target enzyme dihydrofolate reductase":
            "Target enzyme amplification is the resistance mechanism for METHOTREXATE specifically, "

            "Enhanced DNA repair confers resistance to alkylating agents and cisplatin — she received "
            "neither, and it would not affect a vinca alkaloid.",
        "Loss of the enzyme required to activate a prodrug":
            "This is how resistance develops to the purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites "
            "(mercaptopurine, cytarabine, fluorouracil), which must be converted to an active form. "
            "None of her drugs is a prodrug of that kind.",
        "Location of tumour within a pharmacologic sanctuary":
            "A sanctuary site — classically the central nervous system or the testis — shelters "
            "tumour behind a barrier the drug cannot cross. That would not produce systemic "
            "progression across three drug classes.",
    },
    "Increased efflux of drugs by a membrane transporter",
    "Multi-drug resistance from increased expression of MDR1, which encodes P-GLYCOPROTEIN — an "
    "ATP-dependent efflux pump in the cell membrane (the P stands for 'permeability').\n\n"
    "Because the pump recognizes a broad range of hydrophobic substrates, resistance selected by one "
    "drug extends to structurally unrelated drugs that happen to use the same exit: vincristine, "
    "vinblastine, doxorubicin, bleomycin and etoposide all leave through that door. This is ACQUIRED "
    "resistance (it developed after exposure) that is also CROSS-resistance.\n\n"
    "The full list of resistance mechanisms, each tied to its drugs:\n"
    "• Increased DNA repair — alkylating agents, cisplatin\n"
    "• Trapping agents (thiol-rich molecules that bind the drug) — bleomycin, cisplatin, "
    "anthracyclines\n"
    "• Altered or amplified target enzyme — methotrexate and dihydrofolate reductase\n"
    "• Decreased activation of a prodrug, or inactivation of the active drug — purine and pyrimidine "
    "antimetabolites\n"
    "• Decreased drug accumulation by efflux — many agents, and the answer here\n"
    "• Pharmacologic sanctuary — the central nervous system or testis\n\n"
    "The same transporter explains a long list of drug interactions elsewhere: verapamil, "
    "amiodarone, clarithromycin, ketoconazole and rifampin are all described as P-glycoprotein "
    "inhibitors or inducers, which is why they alter direct oral anticoagulant levels.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Overexpression of MDR1 produces the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, which "
    "exports a broad range of structurally unrelated hydrophobic drugs — anthracyclines, vinca "
    "alkaloids, etoposide, bleomycin — so resistance to one agent confers cross-resistance to the "
    "others.",
    "The cancer cells have installed a pump in their outer wall that throws out anything that looks "

    "breathlessness climbing one flight of stairs. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F). Oxygen saturation "
    "is 94% at rest and 87% after walking. Fine inspiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases. "
    "Chest radiography shows bilateral reticular opacities at the lung bases. His hemoglobin is 12.6 "
    "g/dL, leukocyte count is 5,800/mm3 and platelet count is 214,000/mm3. Which agent is most "

    "toxicity is not marrow is the one to suspect.\n\n"
    "Mechanism: the bleomycin-iron complex generates free oxygen radicals that break DNA strands. The "
    "lung is uniquely vulnerable because it lacks bleomycin hydrolase, the enzyme that inactivates "
    "the drug in other tissues. Monitoring is with pulmonary function testing, and the fibrosis may "
    "be irreversible.\n\n"
    "The six dose-limiting toxicity pairings to know as a block:\n"

    "• Peripheral neuropathy — oxaliplatin, vincristine, taxanes\n"
    "• Potentially fatal diarrhoea — irinotecan\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Bleomycin causes pulmonary fibrosis because the lung lacks the "
    "inactivating enzyme bleomycin hydrolase, and it is one of the few cytotoxic drugs that spares "
    "the bone marrow — so a new restrictive lung picture with normal blood counts points to it.",

    "Educational objective: Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are metabolized to acrolein, which "

# ── 86. Why signal transduction inhibitors are small molecules (§45) ───────────
q(
    "An investigator is developing agents against several oncogenic targets. Two candidates are "
    "monoclonal antibodies of about 145,000 daltons, and two are small molecules of a few hundred "
    "daltons. The proposed targets are the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor "
    "receptor, the extracellular domain of HER2, the BCR-ABL1 kinase, and mechanistic target of "
    "rapamycin (mTOR). The investigator finds that antibody candidates directed at the last two "
    "targets have no activity in cell-based assays despite high binding affinity for purified "
    "protein. Which of the following best explains this finding?",
    {
        "Antibodies are degraded by intracellular proteases before reaching the target":
            "Degradation is not the limiting step; the antibody never enters the cytoplasm in the "
            "first place.",
        "Antibodies cannot cross the plasma membrane to reach intracellular targets": "",
        "Antibodies of the IgG4 subclass cannot activate complement":
            "True, and it is exactly why IgG4 is chosen for checkpoint inhibitors — you do not want "
            "to lyse the T cell you are trying to activate. It has nothing to do with reaching an "
            "intracellular kinase.",
        "Small molecules bind targets with higher affinity than antibodies":
            "Antibodies typically bind with very high affinity — the stem states affinity is high. "
            "Access, not affinity, is the problem.",
        "Small molecules are actively imported by membrane transporters":
            "Most cross by passive diffusion because they are small and lipophilic; active import is "
            "not the general explanation.",
    },
    "Antibodies cannot cross the plasma membrane to reach intracellular targets",
    "Size decides where a drug can act, and that single fact organizes the whole of targeted "
    "therapy.\n\n"
    "• An ANTIBODY is roughly 145,000 daltons and cannot cross the plasma membrane, so it can only "
    "engage the EXTRACELLULAR domain of a transmembrane receptor — EGFR (cetuximab, panitumumab), "
    "HER2 (trastuzumab, pertuzumab), VEGF (bevacizumab), CD20 (rituximab)\n"
    "• A SMALL MOLECULE of a few hundred daltons crosses the membrane and can inhibit an "
    "INTRACELLULAR kinase\n\n"
    "The consequence: every signal transduction inhibitor is a small molecule, because those targets "
    "— BCR-ABL, RAF, MEK, mTOR, BTK, PARP, PI3K, CDK4/6 — all sit inside the cell. There are no "
    "monoclonal antibodies in that group.\n\n"
    "The format also predicts the toxicity family, which is how most 'which adverse effect' questions "
    "are answered:\n"
    "• SMALL MOLECULE → pharmacokinetic problems (CYP3A4 interactions, food effects, most taken on an "
    "empty stomach) plus off-target kinase effects — QT prolongation, diarrhoea and raised liver "
    "enzymes are class effects\n"
    "• ANTIBODY → infusion reactions, and on-target toxicity in whatever normal tissue expresses the "
    "antigen — the acneiform rash of EGFR blockade is the cleanest example, since EGFR is highly "
    "expressed in normal skin\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Monoclonal antibodies are too large to cross the plasma membrane and can "
    "only target extracellular receptor domains, so all signal transduction inhibitors — BCR-ABL, "
    "RAF, MEK, mTOR, BTK, PARP, PI3K, CDK4/6 — are small molecules.",

    "• ANTICHOLINERGIC BURDEN SCALE — catches the patient on five individually mild drugs whose "
    "combined load is causing the confusion\n"
    "• STOPP — drugs that should be stopped; STAR — drugs that should be started but have not been. "
    "The under-prescribing half is the one people forget\n"
    "• The pharmacist, named explicitly as a resource\n\n"
    "And the maxim, with its correction: 'start low, go slow — BUT get somewhere'. Stopping at a "
    "sub-therapeutic dose because a patient is old is its own harm, which is what the START half of "
    "START/STOPP exists to catch.\n\n"
    "For comparison, the other two 'no safe medication' slides do offer a fallback: insomnia — "
    "cognitive behavioural therapy and sleep restriction first, then possibly doxepin or trazodone; "
    "anxiety — cognitive behavioural therapy first, then possibly a selective serotonin reuptake "
    "inhibitor, and notably never a benzodiazepine.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: There is no safe pharmacologic treatment for the behavioural symptoms of "
    "dementia; management is non-pharmacologic. Opioids, anticholinergics, sedatives and "
    "antidepressants are the high-risk classes in older adults, screened for with the Beers criteria, "
    "the anticholinergic burden scale and START/STOPP.",
    "Every calming pill available makes older people more likely to fall, get confused and end up in "
    "hospital. The real treatment is changing what happens around her in the evening, not adding a "
    "drug.",
