# ── 1. Fetal hematopoiesis — the liver at mid-gestation (§1) ────────────────────
q(
    "A 26-year-old woman at 23 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of "
    "decreased fetal movement. She and her partner were each previously told they have mildly "
    "microcytic red cell indices with normal iron studies. Ultrasonography shows fetal ascites, "
    "bilateral pleural effusions, scalp edema, and absent cardiac activity. At autopsy, the fetal "
    "liver is markedly enlarged, and sections show numerous clusters of nucleated erythroid "
    "precursors lying between the hepatic cords. The marrow cavities of the long bones are only "
    "sparsely cellular. Hemoglobin analysis of fetal blood shows that nearly all of the hemoglobin "
    "is a tetramer of four identical non-alpha chains. In a healthy fetus of this gestational age, "
    "which of the following is the principal site of blood cell production?",
    {
        "Liver": "",
        "Axial skeleton marrow":
            "This is the ADULT pattern — vertebrae, ribs, sternum and pelvis — after the marrow of "
            "the long bones converts to fat. It is the reason a marrow biopsy is taken from the "
            "posterior iliac crest, not from a fetus's hematopoietic sites.",
        "Long bone marrow":
            "Bone marrow takes over in the LATE fetus and is the dominant site by birth, and in "
            "childhood the long bones are still red. At 23 weeks the long-bone marrow is only "
            "beginning to populate, as this autopsy shows.",
        "Spleen":
            "The fetal spleen contributes to blood formation, but it is the secondary site. The "
            "liver is dominant through mid-gestation.",
        "Thymus":
            "The thymus educates T cells that have already been made — it is a site of lymphocyte "
            "maturation, not a primary site of hematopoiesis at any age.",
        "Yolk sac":
            "The yolk sac makes the first, primitive wave of blood in the EMBRYO (the first weeks "
            "after conception, making embryonic hemoglobins). By the second trimester it has been "
            "replaced by the liver.",
    },
    "Liver",
    "Hydrops fetalis from alpha thalassemia with all four alpha genes deleted. Both parents carry "
    "alpha thalassemia trait (microcytosis with normal iron studies). With no alpha genes, the fetus "
    "makes excess gamma chains → gamma-chain tetramers (hemoglobin Barts) → extreme oxygen affinity → "
    "oxygen is bound and never released → profound tissue hypoxia → heart failure and hydrops.\n\n"
    "The liver finding is a trap only if you forget the timeline. The lifetime sequence is:\n"
    "• Embryo → yolk sac (the first, primitive wave)\n"
    "• Fetus → LIVER (dominant mid-gestation), with a contribution from the spleen\n"
    "• Late fetus onward → bone marrow\n"
    "• Adult → the axial skeleton (vertebrae, ribs, sternum, pelvis); the long bones turn to fat\n\n"
    "So clusters of erythroid precursors in the liver at 23 weeks are expected, and hypoxia would "
    "only exaggerate them. In a CHILD or ADULT the same finding would mean extramedullary "
    "hematopoiesis — the body reopening a site it abandoned under extreme demand (thalassemia major, "
    "severe chronic hemolysis, marrow fibrosis).\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Hematopoiesis moves from the yolk sac (embryo) to the liver and spleen "
    "(fetus) to the bone marrow (late fetus onward), and in adults retreats to the axial skeleton. "
    "Liver hematopoiesis is normal mid-gestation but, after birth, signals extramedullary "
    "hematopoiesis from severe marrow demand.",
    "Before you are born, your liver is the blood factory. Later the job moves into your bones, and "
    "in grown-ups only the bones in the middle of the body keep doing it. If a grown-up's liver "
    "starts making blood again, the body is in serious trouble.",

    excap="Sites of hematopoiesis across development (yolk sac → liver and spleen → bone marrow) "

q(
    "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to 3 weeks of fatigue, easy "

            "and the reticulocytes, and it does not empty the marrow.",
        "Immune destruction of hematopoietic stem cells": "",
        "Inherited defect in DNA cross-link repair":

            "Megaloblastic anemia gives a HYPERcellular marrow (precursors are made, then die "
            "inside it) and a macrocytic MCV. This marrow is nearly all fat.",
        "Marrow replacement by lymphoblasts":
            "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia produces a sick-appearing child, often with splenomegaly "
            "and bone pain, a PACKED marrow and blasts. The biopsy here is empty.",
        "Splenic sequestration of blood cells":
            "Hypersplenism lowers all three lineages, but it needs a big spleen, and the marrow is "
            "normal or hypercellular as it compensates. There is no splenomegaly here.",

    "Acquired aplastic anemia, here following seronegative hepatitis. A well-appearing child with "
    "pancytopenia, a low reticulocyte count, no organomegaly and an acellular marrow is the aplastic "
    "picture in the pediatric differential; the sick-appearing child with splenomegaly is the "
    "leukemic one.\n\n"
    "Mechanism: a trigger (hepatitis, drugs, toxins, viruses, or most often nothing identifiable) → "
    "T cell–mediated attack on the self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells → the stem cell pool "
    "collapses → every lineage fails together → fat fills the empty marrow space.\n\n"
    "Why the biopsy matters: cellularity is a core biopsy reading, not an aspirate reading, because "
    "only the core keeps the architecture — trabeculae and the ratio of cells to fat. Normal "
    "cellularity is roughly 100 minus the patient's age, so an 8-year-old should be about 90% "
    "cellular. A marrow that is mostly fat is hypocellular.\n\n"
    "The inherited mimics are separated by what you can see on examination: Fanconi anemia (short "

    "Diamond-Blackfan anemia (red cells only), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (pancreatic "
    "insufficiency, neutropenia) and thrombocytopenia with absent radii (thumbs present). Definitive "
    "treatment for severe aplastic anemia in a child is a matched sibling marrow transplant.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Aplastic anemia is immune-mediated loss of hematopoietic stem cells, "
    "producing pancytopenia, reticulocytopenia and a fatty, hypocellular marrow on core biopsy. "
    "Leukemia and megaloblastic anemia also cause cytopenias but leave the marrow hypercellular.",
    "The boy's blood factory has lost the special seed cells that make every kind of blood cell, so "

    "In kidney failure the sensor and the factory foreman are the same failed organ. A normocytic "

    "The trap is the erythropoietin value: 11 mU/mL sits inside the reference interval, but for a "
    "hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL it should be many times higher. An 'inappropriately normal' "
    "erythropoietin in the face of anemia is a production failure — the same logic as a 'normal' "
