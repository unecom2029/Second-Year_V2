        "Deficiency of factor XIII":
            "Factor XIII cross-links fibrin AFTER the clot has formed, so the PT, aPTT and platelet "
            "count are all normal. It causes delayed bleeding and delayed wound healing — classically "
            "after circumcision.",
        "Deficiency of von Willebrand factor":
            "Von Willebrand disease bleeds mucocutaneously — nosebleeds, gum bleeding, menorrhagia — "
            "because the protein tethers platelets to collagen. The aPTT is usually normal unless "

            "Glanzmann thrombasthenia prevents fibrinogen from bridging platelets. Again the bleeding "

    "coagulation factor deficiencies bleed into joints and muscles — hemarthrosis and deep "
    "hematomas. He has spaces, not surfaces.\n\n"
    "2. WHICH test is long. An isolated prolonged aPTT with a normal PT points to the intrinsic "

    "(hemophilia B, 1 in 30,000 males) are X-linked and clinically identical — the maternal uncle "

    "Educational objective: Bleeding into joints and muscles indicates a coagulation factor "
    "deficiency, whereas mucocutaneous bleeding indicates a platelet or von Willebrand factor "
    "problem. An isolated prolonged aPTT that corrects on mixing points to deficiency of factor "
    "VIII, IX, XI or XII, and only factor XII deficiency does not bleed.",

            "thrombosis, not spontaneous soft-tissue bleeding.",

            "Heparin from a line draw prolongs the aPTT and fails to correct on mixing, but she is "
            "on no anticoagulant and the finding would not be time-dependent.",

            "Hemophilia B is X-linked and lifelong. A woman of 74 with uneventful surgery and dental "
            "extractions does not have a congenital factor deficiency declaring itself now.",
        "Underfilling of the sodium citrate tube":
            "A short-draw blue top has proportionally too much citrate, which artificially prolongs "
            "the clotting time — but it is a pre-analytic artefact in a patient with no bleeding, and "
            "it corrects fully on mixing.",
        "Vitamin K deficiency from poor intake":

    "diathesis appearing suddenly at 74 is acquired until proven otherwise. Associations: autoimmune "
    "disease (her rheumatoid arthritis), malignancy, and the postpartum state.\n\n"
    "2. An isolated prolonged aPTT — factor VIII is an intrinsic pathway factor.\n\n"
    "3. The mixing study. Adding normal plasma supplies every factor at about 50%, which is enough "
    "for hemostasis, so a DEFICIENCY corrects. An INHIBITOR does not, because the antibody attacks "
    "the donated factor too. The trap here is that anti-factor VIII antibodies are slow and "
    "temperature-dependent: on an immediate mix they look like a deficiency, and only after "
    "incubation at 37 C for 30–60 minutes does the clotting time drift back out. An immediate mix "
    "that corrects therefore does not exclude an inhibitor.\n\n"
    "Confirm with a factor VIII activity level and a Bethesda titre to quantify the antibody. "
    "Management has two halves: control bleeding with a BYPASSING agent (infused factor VIII would "
    "simply be neutralized), and eradicate the antibody with immunosuppression — which is what "
    "distinguishes acquired from congenital disease, where the deficiency is permanent.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: A new bleeding diathesis in an older adult with an isolated prolonged "
    "aPTT that fails to correct on an INCUBATED mixing study indicates an acquired factor VIII "
    "inhibitor. Treatment is a bypassing agent for bleeding plus immunosuppression to eradicate the "
    "antibody.",
    "Her body has started making an antibody that destroys one of her clotting proteins. Adding "

            "activity is 20%.",
        "An acquired antibody against von Willebrand factor":
            "Acquired von Willebrand disease occurs with lymphoproliferative disease, and mechanically "
            "in aortic stenosis (Heyde syndrome). Lifelong symptoms from menarche with two affected "

        "Deficient hepatic synthesis of factor VIII":
            "Factor VIII is not made by hepatocytes at all — it is largely endothelial in origin and "
            "circulates bound to von Willebrand factor. Her factor VIII is normal.",
        "Loss of the platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor":
            "Bernard-Soulier syndrome is the other side of the same handshake — the GPIb receptor "
            "rather than the ligand. It gives a low platelet count with large platelets, and the "
            "ristocetin cofactor assay uses normal fixed platelets specifically to exclude it.",

    "A qualitative defect in von Willebrand factor",
    "Type 2 von Willebrand disease. The whole algorithm is one comparison: are ACTIVITY and ANTIGEN "
    "similar?\n\n"
    "• Similar → the protein works normally, there is just not enough of it → QUANTITATIVE disease "

    "Why size matters: von Willebrand factor must stretch from collagen at the injury site out into "
    "flowing blood to catch a passing platelet by its GPIb receptor. Hemostatic activity therefore "
    "tracks multimer size, and a patient who makes only short multimers has plenty of antigen and "
    "still bleeds.\n\n"
    "Two further points in this vignette. Her normal aPTT is expected — von Willebrand disease is a "
    "disease of PRIMARY hemostasis, and the plasma clotting assays cannot see platelet function at "
    "all; only severe (type 3) disease prolongs the aPTT, by dragging factor VIII down with it. And "
    "menorrhagia from menarche with an affected mother and sister is the most commonly missed "
    "presentation of the most common inherited bleeding disorder.\n\n"
    "Treatment follows the subtype: desmopressin releases stored von Willebrand factor from "
    "endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies and works in type 1, but it is avoided in type 2B, where it "
    "worsens thrombocytopenia; types 2B and 3 need a plasma-derived or recombinant von Willebrand "
    "factor concentrate. Note also that group O individuals run lower levels at baseline — her group "
    "A makes a spuriously low value less likely.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Comparing von Willebrand factor activity with antigen separates "
    "quantitative disease (types 1 and 3, both reduced proportionally) from qualitative disease "
    "(type 2, activity disproportionately low with loss of high molecular weight multimers). The "
    "routine coagulation screen is normal in most cases.",

    "pressure, and two blood blisters on the buccal mucosa. There is no lymphadenopathy, "
    "hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or bone tenderness.\n\n"
    "Laboratory studies show:\n"
    "Hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL (N=11.5–15.5 g/dL)\n"
    "Leukocyte count 7,400/mm3 (N=4,500–13,500/mm3)\n"

    "Partial thromboplastin time 31 sec (N=25–40 sec)\n\n"
    "The peripheral smear shows markedly reduced platelets with occasional large forms, and normal "
    "red cell and leukocyte morphology. If a bone marrow examination were performed, which of the "
    "following would most likely be found?",
    {
        "Absence of megakaryocytes with preserved other lineages":
            "Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and acquired pure megakaryocyte aplasia do "

        "Extensive fibrosis with tear-drop red cells":
            "Marrow fibrosis produces a leukoerythroblastic smear with tear-drop cells, nucleated red "

    "Acute immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — post-viral, in a well child, with ISOLATED "
    "thrombocytopenia, normal clotting times and an otherwise normal smear.\n\n"
    "Mechanism: IgG autoantibody against platelet surface glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The antibody is "
    "made in the spleen AND the coated platelets are consumed in the spleen — one organ doing both "
    "jobs, which is why the treatment ladder works the way it does.\n\n"
    "Because the destruction is PERIPHERAL, the marrow is not the problem: it responds by increasing "
    "megakaryocytes. That single finding separates destruction from underproduction, and it is the "
    "reason the other five options — each of which is a marrow-failure or marrow-replacement "
    "picture — are wrong.\n\n"
    "Note the supporting details: petechiae are non-blanching (hemorrhage, not rash); 'wet purpura' "
    "on the oral mucosa marks a higher bleeding risk than skin findings alone; and splenomegaly is "
    "RARE in ITP, so a big spleen should redirect you to hypersplenism, a lymphoproliferative "
    "disorder or portal hypertension.\n\n"
    "A marrow biopsy is not actually required in a typical case. Management in children is usually "
    "observation — about 80% recover spontaneously and intracranial hemorrhage occurs in under 0.1% "
    "— with IVIG or corticosteroids reserved for significant bleeding, and avoidance of aspirin and "
    "contact sports meanwhile.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Immune thrombocytopenia is peripheral antibody-mediated platelet "

            "Myelodysplasia can present with thrombocytopenia, but usually with other cytopenias, "
            "dysplastic morphology on the smear, and in an older patient.",
        "Progression to a thrombotic microangiopathy":
            "A microangiopathy would add schistocytes, hemolytic anemia and organ injury. Her "

        "Infection stimulating antibody production":

    "Relapsed immune thrombocytopenia from a missed accessory spleen — and the smear proves it.\n\n"
    "After a complete splenectomy, red cells retain nuclear remnants that a working spleen would pit "
    "out, so HOWELL-JOLLY BODIES appear on the smear and stay there. Their ABSENCE 8 months after "
    "splenectomy means functioning splenic tissue is still present somewhere.\n\n"
    "Why that matters mechanistically: in ITP the spleen is both the factory making the "
    "anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibody and the site where the antibody-coated platelets are "
    "destroyed. Leave functioning splenic tissue behind and both jobs continue. Accessory spleens "
    "occur in about 20% of people, and more than 80% of them sit immediately adjacent to the spleen "
    "— so they are easy to miss and easy to find once suspected (imaging, or a heat-damaged red cell "
    "scan).\n\n"
    "Splenectomy otherwise gives sustained remission in 75%–85% of refractory patients. When it "
    "genuinely fails and no accessory spleen is found, the next options work at the two ends of the "
    "problem: rituximab removes the B cells making the antibody, and romiplostim (a thrombopoietin "
    "receptor agonist) pushes production instead of protecting the platelets.\n\n"
    "Educational objective: Recurrence of immune thrombocytopenia after an initially successful "
    "splenectomy suggests a retained accessory spleen, present in about 20% of people; the absence of "
    "Howell-Jolly bodies on the peripheral smear indicates that functioning splenic tissue remains.",
    "Her spleen was removed because it was eating her platelets, but people often have a small extra "
    "spleen hiding nearby. The clue is that her blood cells still look 'cleaned', which only a "
    "working spleen does.",

    "The general rule since the 2021 CHEST guideline is to prefer a direct oral anticoagulant over "
    "warfarin: efficacy is equal, bleeding (especially intracranial) is lower, and no monitoring is "
